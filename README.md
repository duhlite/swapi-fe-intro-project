# Star Wars API Project

## Goal
Using the Star Wars API (http://www.swapi.co, https://swapi.co/documentation), create a website that consumes the data from the Star Wars API and displays it in a functional and usable way. For instance, on your home page, you may want to list all of the films, and allow a user to click on a particular film, which will re-load your website with a particular query string (ie: http://mycoolwebsite.com?film=1), and subsequently load that particular piece of data.
